title: Changing StorageClass with Redpanda Operator
teaser: Learn how to change the K8s storage class used by Redpanda.
description: |-
  Redpanda is a Kafka-compatible streaming data platform that is less complex and less costly than any other commercial mission-critical event streaming platform. It's fast, it's easy, and it keeps your data safe.

  The Redpanda Operator extends Kubernetes with custom resource definitions (CRDs), allowing you to define Redpanda clusters as native Kubernetes resources. The resource that the Redpanda Operator uses to represent a Redpanda cluster is the Redpanda resource.

  In this tutorial, you learn how to switch the storage class that Redpanda will use when creating Persistent Volume Claims when deployed using the Redpanda Operator.
